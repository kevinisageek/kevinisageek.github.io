                <div class="entry-content"><p>EDC is becoming increasingly digital these days. Often people go out the door with a multitude of devices; phone, ebook reader, tablet, rechargeable flashlight et al. Having a means to support these devices is a good idea, especially if access to power is unreliable or a while away.</p>
<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinisageek/32741084910/in/dateposted/" title="EDC electronics support kit"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/699/32741084910_9584f98f2f_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="EDC electronics support kit"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>My support kit is built around a Tecknet 15000mAh USB battery. This provides several charges for my USB devices to keep them (and by extension, me) happy over the course of a day or more. It has proven its worth at my former job where the van power socket was broken and I had to run my SatNav for the day off the battery.</p>
<p>Of course, having a battery is useless without the ability to actually charge devices. To that end, I have a micro USB cable and an Apple Lightning cable (iPhone, sue me) which will let me charge the vast majority of anything I come across.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have a set of headphones to avoid being subject to sonic assault from the world at large.</p>
<p>A USB fast charge adapter rounds up the power side of things. Public USB sockets are suspect at best, who knows what is on the other side of the connector. Could be a dumb power supply, could be a full blown computer sucking down all your phone data and sending it off to shady places, possibly giving you malware at the same time. Don't be a fool, protect your tool.</p>
<p>The last few items in the kit aren't strictly power related but they fit in well anyway. I have a physical GPG smart card reader with built in smart card so I can do GPG stuff and have a good degree of confidence that if either my laptop or the kit gets stolen/lost, folk can't impersonate me by email. I have a Kingston 32GB pendrive for quick data storage/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet">transfer</a> and lastly, a lighter. Because fire is a good thing to have on command.</p>

<p>The whole lot fits nicely into a Maxpedition mini pocket organiser which lets me transfer everything between bags quickly and <a href="http://redteams.net/gear/2015/modular-packing-light-is-fast">keeps everything modular</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwY9maR-4qg">and neat</a>.</p>

              <h1 class="entry-title">
                <a href="../../2014/04/04/bike-power/">Bike Power</a></h1>
                <div class="entry-content"><p>A good year ago I bought a cheap dynamo from eBay. The lights that came
with it were utter garbage and I chucked them. The dynamo got installed
and left to linger on the bike.</p>
<p>Over the past couple weeks, I have been tinkering around with the idea
of getting the dynamo running and producing useful power for when I'm
riding. The first generation system was simply a bridge rectifier and
the largest capacitor I had in my parts crate. Pedalling by hand
produced a healthy 20+ volts with no load attached.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my buddy Scott and I had a day off and it was decided that
this project would step up a gear. We decided that the best course of
action would be to get a proper power supply setup rather than a cobbled
together mish-mash amalgamation of random components. There are a number
of things suitable for power generation but nothing really suited 100%.
We decided that <a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/k18231a-power-supply-kit-ve58n">a kit from
Maplin</a> was
the best route to go down. It provides for potential expansion in the
future, just need to swap out the regulator. Currently it is capped at 1
amp at 5 volts. If I decide I want more amps, it will cost about Â£2 to
upgrade. Not bad.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2014/04/IMG_20140403_140058.jpg"><img alt="IMG_20140403_140058" src="/images/2014/04/IMG_20140403_140058-300x225.jpg" /></a>We
opted to alter the configuration of the components from the kit
defaults. The large capacitor is moved off to the side so that it will
fit in the project box and the regulator is now fitted outside the box
with a heatsink for better cooling.</p>
<p>After fiddling with the adjustment potentiometer (tiny movements are
needed to get to the right voltage) and testing with a sacrificial
device, we test rode the setup.</p>

<p>Need to get the box fastened down properly and everything tidied up, as
well as get a proper mount for my phone but for all intents and
purposes, job done! Not bad for an afternoon's work.</p>
