I've just finished working on Serenity for the day. I would have been
finished hours ago on a job that was supposed to be about 30 seconds
long. I was relocating the aux battery ground point to a seatbelt mount
to cut down on the amount of wiring running all over the place.

I was torquing the nut down to the post when suddenly it got very easy
to turn. Lifted the wrench off and saw that the post had sheared.

Balls.

Of course, being a Land Rover, things are never that simple to fix. If
the post was in fact a bolt that could be removed, this 30 second job
would have turned into a mere 5 minute job. Sadly, the post is welded
into place.

Cock.

Cue 20 minutes underneath faffing about with the socket set and a
spanner removing 2 nuts and bolts that have been covered up with the
general crud that accumulates under Land Rovers. Didn't help that I was
scraping my knuckles on the outrigger every 10 seconds.

Eventually the bolts came out and after a little prying the plate
dropped onto my gut, along with more built up crap from behind it. I
must have looked a right state getting out from under Serenity.

The next task was to grind off the remainder of the post and then drill
a new hole for a replacement bolt. Easy enough though my drill bits
leave a lot to be desired.

Screwfix is a great place to go to get replacement fixings and fittings.
Cheap and they do stainless steel nuts and bolts. However, I must have a
wee rant about something.

Bolts are sold in packs of 10. Washers in packs of 10. Nuts in packs of
100.

WHY!!!!

What the hell am I gonna do with 100 nuts! I only needed 3! Come on
Screwfix, sell nuts in packs of 10! Make it easier for the DIY crowd to
get stuff done.

Anyway, I have the bits I need and the plate is drying after having rust
and crap ground off and a coat of hammerite.Â  Need to do the other side
but that can wait till tomorrow.

Land Rover Defender ownership is never easy.
