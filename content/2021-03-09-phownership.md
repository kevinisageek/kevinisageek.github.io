[To writ](http://misc-stuff.terraaeon.com/articles/computer-i-own.html):

>  I want a computer that can be completely autonomous when I want it to be, but which can also be used to communicate securely with anyone on the planet without being observed by a third party. I don't want to be spied on by Microsoft or Google. I don't want the NSA intercepting my conversations or even their metadata. I want complete autonomy and privacy without having to resort to workarounds that have been invented to give me back some of the control I should have had in the first place.

I agree completely and would add on that mobile phones should be the same way. We carry around these fantastic devices capable of computational feats that would be unimaginable last century, with near instant access to the world's information and yet, we are bombarded with advertising and have our data hoovered up and sold.
