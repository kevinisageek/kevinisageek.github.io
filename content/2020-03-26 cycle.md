and a shakedown of a new commuter setup. Since switching to the [TAD Fast Pack EDC](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/fast-pack-edc/), I've had to commute with my pack on my back which makes for a moist time. My former GR1 setup could be [hung on the pannier rack with a little modification](/2019/03/10/pannier) but I can't replicate that with the Fast Pack.

[Pig Monkey posted](https://pig-monkey.com/2020/03/rok-straps/) about [Rok straps](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075X4CNJY/) earlier so I picked up a pair and went for a quick ride with my usual commuter loadout strapped to the rack. Some minor movement but otherwise pretty solid.
