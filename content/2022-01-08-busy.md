by Rekka and Devine of [100 Rabbits](http://100r.co/site/about_us.html). It tells the story of how they sailed from Shimoda, Japan to Victoria, Canada. It simultaneously makes me want to buy a boat and also never be anywhere near open water for the rest of my life.

> A giant wave broke over us, and knocked Pino over. I didnâ€™t see it happen. A wall of water washed over me. I saw nothing but water. I fell. The water dragged me off my feet, and carried me right out of the cockpit. I was underwater, my vision blurred by a curtain of seawater. I was facing up, I could see shapes, and colors through the salty, wet veil enveloping me. I remember thinking then: "Well, this is the end. This is how it happens."

Along with [Steven Roberts](https://microship.com/) and [Peter Knowles](https://www.youtube.com/c/TravelsWithGeordie/videos), they increase my wanderlust.
