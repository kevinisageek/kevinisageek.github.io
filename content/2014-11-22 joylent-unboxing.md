if you have been on the internet the past couple of years, you will have
heard of [Soylent](http://www.soylent.me/). Not the stuff made from
people but the nutritionally complete meal replacement milkshake stuff.
Well, I wanted to get my hands on some. Sadly, they don't ship outside
America. This left a few options.

I could have it remailed at a hefty cost, about the price of the Soylent
itself. No go. I could go across and bring some back but attempting to
get a box of white powder across borders would prove very interesting.
Last option was [DIY](http://diy.soylent.me/).

Enter [Joylent](http://www.joylent.eu/). The European answer to Soylent.
Reformulated to match EU nutritional guidelines and only 5 Euros to ship
to the UK from The Netherlands. I promptly placed an order.

of the recommended daily intake of everything.

much a box of powder.

I am a first time customer, they sent out a mixer bottle. Already have
one for making up protein shakes for lifting but its a nice touch.

Joylent itself. Looks like milkshake powder. The packaging has since
been [upgraded to nifty looking
bags](https://twitter.com/joylentshake/status/535751541060538369). One
bag equals one day of food. Ten bags in the box. Three meals per bag so
30 meals.

is supplied in these containers. Two of them in the box. One little tub
per day. Not a fan of how the oil is packaged, looks prone to leaking.

nothing else, I won't starve for a few days. Could make for good
backpacking food, simple to prepare and doesn't require any fuel. Also
good for emergency rations though I am unsure about the lifespan of the
oil.

I plan to have one or two Joylent meals a day. Not going full time for
now.

Suppose I better make up a batch to try it.
