Recently, Jon Antilles [reposted a masterlist](http://jon-antilles.tumblr.com/post/180553338356/my-masterlist-of-how-to-life-tips) which had a [link to a post](https://exilelifestyle.com/reset/) by [Colin Wright](https://twitter.com/colinismyname). Digging around, I fond that Colin hosts a podcast, [Let's Know Things](https://letsknowthings.com/), which aims to give [contextual information](https://letsknowthings.com/episode0/) on a wide range of subjects (including [tech](https://letsknowthings.com/episode2/), [politics](https://letsknowthings.com/episode112/) and [sociology](https://letsknowthings.com/episode26/)) and integrates them into a high level view of how they fit in the world.

The episodes are not particularly in depth, being about 45 to 90 minutes long but they do give a good jumping off point for folk wanting to research them further. Or just gently drift off to sleep to Colin's gravelly voice (dangerous when on night shift).
