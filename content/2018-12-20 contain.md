Firefox added containers to compartmentalise web browsing. A smart individual took that concept and made an [add-on to containerise the abomination](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/facebook-container/) known as Facebook.

Today, I found that another person took that idea and [made one to corral Twitter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitter-container/) and I had the idea to see if the same has been done for Google. [It has](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/google-container/).

Those 3 add-ons should go a way to keeping data leakage under control. Of course, augmenting your browser with [uMatirx](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/) and [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) is thoroughly recommended for further hardening.
