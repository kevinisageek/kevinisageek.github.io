So far, no real issues. [Like the first one](/2021/06/15/jab/), my arm is tender and warm at the injection site but seems to be going away faster this time. I also had a warm neck while at work last night.

I was warned by a couple of friends about bad headaches and appetite loss but neither of those have happened. Very slight headache due to night shift lack of sleep but nothing to make me reach for painkillers.

In a couple weeks, I should have full immunity and will be contributing to getting this pandemic over and done with.
