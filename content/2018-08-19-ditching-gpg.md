Title: Ditching GPG

I've been a user of GPG for over a decade if I recall. Been through some trials and tribulations with keychain issues (admittedly mostly PEBKAC) and even switched to using a hardware token for storing my keys on to increase security.

The issue is, the folk I am primarily in contact with don't use GPG. One friend maintains a keychain himself but our communications are over Telegram for the most part. I have had more encrypted emails from Facebook than all other contacts put together. Say what you will about other communications systems and their cryptography (or lack thereof) but they just get out of the way and let me get my messages out to people.

So I am thinking I will ditch the use of GPG. I see no utility in keeping a keychain up to date with subkeys and expiries and moving things to the token etc for one person I don't communicate with on that medium.

If anyone has a really good reason for me to expend effort in maintaining my keychain then please contact me, ideally using GPG. Otherwise I will likely revoke my keys some point this week.
