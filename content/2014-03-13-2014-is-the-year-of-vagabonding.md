Lots of travelling going on this year. First up, I'm camping in
[Galloway forest](http://www.gallowayforestpark.com/) for a week in May.
Then in August I'm headed to Illinois to meet up with some folks to head
down to Indiana for [Gencon](http://www.gencon.com/). The week after
that is [Electromagnetic Field
2014](http://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_Field_2014). Then if
I can get the time off from work, I will be going to the next Chaos
Communications Congress in Germany.

Good times.
