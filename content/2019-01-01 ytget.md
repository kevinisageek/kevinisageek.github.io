I've been a fan of command line scripts and software to get tasks done for a while now. A few weeks ago, I tried having a go at hacking on [Bashpodder](http://lincgeek.org/bashpodder/) to add Youtube functionality via the use of [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) to get videos automatically, podcast style.

Annoyingly, I couldn't make it run properly and left it for a while. Until this morning when I had some coffee and decided to just break out the functionality to a separate script. Two scripts for podcast downloading may be a bit much but needs must.

Like my bashpodder hack, this script requires youtube-dl to be installed.

It also requires two text files to be in your home folder (or symlinked from elsewhere). `.ytget.conf` is a list of channels that you want to download from, whether from Youtube or [any other service that youtube-dl supports](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html). `.ytget.lastrun` just contains a timestamp in `date +%Y%m%d` format - eg. 20190101 - that is when the script was last ran. I recommend initially using a date from a month or two ago, else the script will default to 20180101 and get all videos uploaded since then.

[Grab the script](/media/scripts/ytget), stick it in your `$PATH` and grab your Youtube subscriptions, free from the need to have a Google account!
