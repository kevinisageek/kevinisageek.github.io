those wondering what the hell this british guy means by wombling, [The
Wombles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wombles) were a fictional
species of anthropomorphic burrowing creatures who reused and recycled
human rubbish. Wombling therefore refers to the act of making use of
waste that others would simply throw in the bin (or worse, leave on the
ground for others to deal with). In this case, I have wombled a large
amount of polypropylene rope and several meters of good quality copper
wire from a skip.

Who in their right mind throws away mains thickness copper?! At the
very least, it could be scrapped for cash.

The rope hasn't been cared for particularly well. I will need to get the
ends whipped to prevent further fraying. Its nowhere near recovery grade
so no towing or winching but it will be useful for tying down stuff.Â 
Free cordage is always a good thing.

Its worth keeping an eye out for things that have been discarded that
could be of use. As the saying goes, one man's garbage is another's
treasure.
