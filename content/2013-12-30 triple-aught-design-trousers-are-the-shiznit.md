They really are. So comfortable. Pockets within pockets. Only been
wearing them (Force 10 AC cargo in tan btw) for about 10 minutes and I
have fallen in love. Well, when I was in America I got a chance to look
at the pair that [Pig Monkey](http://pig-monkey.com) gave to Avagdu as a
wedding gift. Decided then I wanted my own.

I ordered through [Heinnie
Haynes](http://www.heinnie.com/TAD-Gear-/Trousers-&-Shorts/Force-10-AC-Cargo-Trousers/p-1040-1227-8996/)
here in the UK, less hassle than ordering direct from America, less
customs fees and shipping and whatnot.
