[The podcast](https://www.nonprophet.media/dissect-podcast) is a long form discussion (with a significant number of rabbit holes along the way), primarily focused on fitness and nutrition. The hosts are not afraid to tell it how they see it from their point of view of being highly advanced athletes in a number of disciplines.

If you have several hours and want some knowledge bombs about being fit and healthy, give it a shot.
