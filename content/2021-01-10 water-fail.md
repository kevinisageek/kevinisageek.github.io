The property next door has suffered some sort of failure with their water, there was a constant stream of it being ejected and required the fire brigade to force entry to see what the issue is. However they couldn't stop it so the water was shut off at the stopcock outside that property.

For reasons unknown to me, this block of flats is also served via this stopcock, resulting in zero cold water pressure.

Naturally, [I have prepared for this](/2020/03/05/sterile).
