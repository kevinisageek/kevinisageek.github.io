[Jocko and Echo](http://jockopodcast2.com/) both sing the praises of [Onnit's Shroom Tech](https://www.onnit.com/shroomtech-immune/) products which claim to help both immune system and physical fitness. Sadly, Onnit products are quite pricy, more than I can justify right now. So I got a generic version.

Been taking these strange brown capsules twice daily for about a week now. This is totally subjective and may be completely placebo but I do feel better and happier. My athletic performance feels stronger and unusually I'm not feeling famished mid-afternoon. No capacity to do a proper double-blind trial but this impromptu experiment does seem to be a success.

If I ever end up [sprouting growths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuKjBIBBAL8) from my body ([or worse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us)), please incinerate me.
