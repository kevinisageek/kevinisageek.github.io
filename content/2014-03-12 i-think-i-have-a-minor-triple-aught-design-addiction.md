Now own 2 pairs of TAD trousers. Force 10 AC to be precise, tan and grey
colours. Best. Trousers. EVER! Hell, I may retire my DPM trousers.

Bought them from [Hennie
Haynes](http://www.heinnie.com/Clothing/TAD-Gear-/c-1-461-1040/) who I
cannot praise enough. Ordered yesterday at about 3pm, arrived at about
10am this morning. They are bloody quick at processing orders and they
nearly always arrive next day. Even with free shipping.

Now, if I could get them in navy blue so I can use them for work instead
of the naff trousers provided.
