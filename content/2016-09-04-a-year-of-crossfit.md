Well, year and a few weeks. Been going 2-3 times a week to [Claymore Crossfit](http://claymorecrossfit.co.uk/) and I have to say, I have had a blast. Cardio has improved, lifts have gone up, all round fitness has increased. And I have to credit it with some other benefits to my life.

Here's to another year of Crossfit!
