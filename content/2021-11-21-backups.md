Title: Backup Strategy

Just over 2 years ago I wrote a post about [my backup strategy](/2019/11/19/backups-old). Back then, I was using [rsnapshot](https://rsnapshot.org/) as my utility of choice. However, that has been [deprecated in the Debian repos](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=986709) so I figured I would use the opportunity to switch to using [Borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/).

[Pig Monkey has done the vast majority of the heavy lifting](https://pig-monkey.com/2017/07/borg/) with a wrapper script. I have basically just made a few versions of that wrapper with a couple of tweaks to increase the retention times, as well as multiple backup locations (storage is cheap and plentiful, I have a 2.5" USB3 hard drive and a beefy Synology NAS). I also have offsite backups thanks to [rsync.net](https://www.rsync.net/cloudstorage.html).

Again, like the previous post, there are a [handful of systemd units](/media/scripts/borg) set to start the backups every hour, depending on [what network I am on](https://github.com/pigmonkey/nmtrust).
