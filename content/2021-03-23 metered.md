I have a podcast script that fires off every 6 hours when my computer is on. Normally, this is a good thing, particularly when it is at home. However, my work involves night shifts. There is no usable network available so I have to tether to my phone. Now, my data allowance is variable, depending on how cheap I am feeling when the previous allowance runs out. Having my computer chew through that downloading podcasts is not desirable.

Duncan pointed out the [existence of a repo](https://github.com/jdorel/systemd-metered-connection-dependency) that consists of a [systemd](https://systemd.io/) service file and a shell script which are used to detect if the current network connection is metered and stop running a service.
