At 21:00 PT, after 20 years of continuous broadcasting, [the internet's longest running internet radio station is coming to an end](https://www.reddit.com/r/RantMedia/comments/ac97lq/rantradio_january_3_1999_january_3_2019/). James O'Brien (aka Cimmerian) made the decision to end the run instead of letting it atrophy and wither away.

Sad to see it go, [Patrolling](http://rantmedia.ca/patrolling/) was a formative part of my teenage years and I fully credit [Rant](https://rantmedia.ca) with the solid friendships and the current relationship I have.
