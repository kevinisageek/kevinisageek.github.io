On Christmas Day last year, I made the decision to not consume any
alcoholic drinks for a year. I am pleased to say that I have managed
that goal. Like I thought, it was pretty easy. Five nights of drinking a
year to zero is a pretty simple goal to reach.

Another year teetotal? Challenge accepted!
