Since switching to [Debian Testing](https://www.debian.org/releases/testing/) full time, I have had issues with HDMI audio not working. Videos would play at increased speed and sound would stutter or be completely absent. Using the stable kernel 4.19 works but since [Debian 11 has been released](https://www.debian.org/News/2021/20210814), 5.10 is now stable.

To cut a long story short, today I [found a link on the Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Intel_graphics#No_sound_through_HDMI_on_a_Haswell_CPU) which said to add `intel_iommu=on,igfx_off` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` line in `/etc/default/grub`. Run `sudo update-grub` and reboot to have HDMI sound on the latest (by Debian standards) kernel.

I hope this helps someone else. For reference, this is on a Lenovo Thinkpad T440p, using the Intel i915 driver with nonfree firmware enabled.
