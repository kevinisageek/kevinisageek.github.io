I have a bike. I don't use it. This needs to change.

Problem was, my commute is mostly during the evening and in winter, this
is in the dark. So, for legal and safety reasons, I haven't commuted
under my own power for a while. Now, I can.

New light[/caption]

I wanted a rear light that used AA batteries so I can standardise on
them for all of my kit. I will be migrating to rechargable ones shortly,
once my current stash of AA batteries runs out.

The problem with this light is there is no real attachment point for it.
There are some mouldings on the inside to hold bolts in place but
nothing else.

Internal mouldings[/caption]

However, the existing reflector on the bike has some sort of bracket
holding it on. Wheels began to turn and ideas were formulated.

can now cycle to and from work with less excuse for drivers to hit me.
Whether or not they will pay attention is another matter.
