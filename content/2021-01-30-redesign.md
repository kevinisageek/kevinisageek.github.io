I've been meaning to give this place a tidy up and a refresh for quite some time now. However, not being particularly skilled in the arts of web development I have been putting it off until I could no longer deal with it.

The site used to have a somewhat modified [pelican-bootstrap3](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3) theme which came with an awful lot of cruft. Loads of unused CSS and class decelerations, unneeded `<div>`s all over the place, it was a mess.

Now the site is working better than ever. [Search](/search) works properly, same with the [books list](/books) and loading is near instant.

And in a few years I will do it all again.
