A few days ago my friend [Scott](http://baconstrip.org.uk/) and I made a
couple of videos.

This one is about stoves and whatnot.

This one is about the fire kit I threw together the night before.

This will hopefully be a semi-intermittent thing, especially now that we
have 2 cameras for capture. Recorded some stuff today so expect that in
the near future.
