I've been chewing through [Terry Pratchett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett)'s [Discworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld) books while at work (lockdown is great, so much peace and quiet). Sadly, he has passed away but there is a [movement around keeping him alive](http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/) in a sense, via the use of technology.

In my case, its an easy change to my nginx configuration. Just add ``add_header X-Clacks-Overhead "GNU Terry Pratchett";`` to a ``server`` or ``location`` block.

Additionally, there is a [Firefox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/x-clacks-overhead) to let you see who is also participating, as well as [a list](https://xclacksoverhead.org/listing/the-signal).
