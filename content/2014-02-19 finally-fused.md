Finally got an inline fuse on my auxiliary electrical stuff. For a long
time, the kit has just been protected by the fuse box but if the main
power feed were to be shorted, bad things would happen. Until now.

Sadly I haven't come up with a proper way of fixing the fuse box in
place. It is just pinned in place with the box lid. Works well enough,
not like it has any place to move to.

Only 2 of the relay bases are populated. Room for expansion.

Much cleaner than the corrugated sleeving that I had running about the
place.
