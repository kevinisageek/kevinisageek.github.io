I have never been much of a watch person. I had one in my youth for a while and also got a cheap thing with a whole bunch of features that I never used a few years ago. It got sold on eBay.

I have been mulling over the idea of getting a decent watch for a while. There have been many a time when I wanted to know the time but found my only timepiece (my phone) to be either inaccessable (usually while driving) or a pain to get out of my pocket (due to the rubber case). Having something on my wrist would go a long way to alleviate those issues.

I had a look at the mechanical, automatic winding watches that were on offer. My eyes popped out of their sockets at some of the prices. Over a grand. That is silly money for something that is likely to be battered about going through doors and out in the wilds. Something cheaper was needed. Much cheaper.

I was stalking through [Brian Green's site](http://briangreen.net) when I came across [his review](http://briangreen.net/2014/11/webbem-traveler-analog-outdoor-watch.html) of the [Webbem Traveller](http://www.webbem.com/collections/traveler) watch. The featureset is what I want; minimal, just the analogue hands, no date. Price is pretty good. Bit more than I would like to spend but it does come with a certain classyness about it. Free worldwide shipping and a container that could be useful. Sold.

I opted to get the model with the black NATO strap. Paracord, while useful in an emergency, is too thick and impractical for EDC use. Plus I'm not a fan of the paracord bracelet look.
