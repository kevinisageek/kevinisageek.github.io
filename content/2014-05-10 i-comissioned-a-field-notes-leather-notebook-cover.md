Field Notes notebooks are among the best notebooks currently made. Good
quality paper, fits in my pocket very well and are just a pleasure to
write on. Sadly, the paper cover doesn't stand up well to minor abuse. A
cover is needed to give some protection.

Field Notes make a couple of leather products to fufill this requirement
but given that they are at the \$80+ price point I decided against one
of those. Far too much money for a few bits of leather stitched
together. Ebay was the same.

My buddy [Drayygon](https://twitter.com/Drayygon) has been doing a few
bits of leatherwork for a couple years now so I asked about the
possibility of commissioning him to make a cover. For the princely sum
of Â£15 I am pleased.

It is a simple affair with 3 leather panels stitched together to hold
the cover to the notebook. No faff, no extra guff.

still fits in the slot pockets on my TAD trousers. Little tight but will
get in. Cheers Drayygon!
