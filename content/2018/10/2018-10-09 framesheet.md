I've been rocking a [Goruck GR1](https://www.goruck.com/GR1) as my EDC pack for several years now. Sadly, over time the stock plastic framesheet has slacked off a bit and allows the pack to sag when it is sitting upright. Its a common issue with Goruck packs but is easily replicated with a 3m A3 sheet of [Kydex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kydex) from Ebay.

Simply pull out the stock sheet, draw round it onto the Kydex and cut out with some sort of rotary tool. Wrestle it back in, job done.

Don't forget your eye protection for when structural failures happen.
