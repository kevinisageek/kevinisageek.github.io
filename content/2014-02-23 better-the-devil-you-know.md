Independence.

Conjures up visions of bloody struggle and violent revolution. But this
isn't Ukraine or Venezuela. The streets don't run red with the blood of
people fighting for their lives.

No, this is altogether a much less violent affair. A bunch of middle
aged men and women having [childish
arguments](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/13/us-britain-scotland-idUSBREA1C00B20140213)
about the future of a nation.

As someone who lives north of the imaginary line in the ground that
divides this island, I am frequently asked what I think of the whole
deal. How will I vote?

Honestly? I have no idea.

I am fairly anarchist leaning and as a result, I would like power to be
moved more towards the individual. Independence would be a step in that
direction. Not being governed by a group that allows the Church of
England to have a say in folk's lives does appeal to me.

However, ideology is not the best thing to make such a decision on. Can
Scotland survive being split from the rest of the UK? Do we have the
economic power to make it? Oil won't last forever and the shipyards
certainly aren't making boats any time soon.

The Scottish Parliament (Alex Salmond and co) seems to think we can.
They have produced [a rather weighty
book](https://scotgov.theapsgroupinscotland.com/) which can be delivered
for free for you to have a read. My Dad got a copy and when I had a
flick through, it was dripping with fervent nationalism from the first
page.

I do know one thing. If Scotland does get independence, it will make my
trips to Yorkshire a hassle. The Tories have said they will institute
border controls which will undoubtedly make things very difficult. The
economic losses from the time taken for lorries to cross the border
alone will make life more interesting.

The other issue I have with gaining independence is that the Prime
Minister will be Alex Salmond. I really do not want that smug face on TV
for months. The man is an arse. His sole platform for years has been
"independence will fix everything". OK, maybe a little artistic licence
has been taken but you get the point.

I also take issue with allowing those 16 and over to vote on the matter
as opposed to the usual 18 or over. I don't know about you but I don't
trust 16 year olds to act in a rational matter on this subject. You just
know they are gonna broadcast
[Bravehart](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braveheart_%281995_film%29)
the night before the referendum to whip them up and "fight back against
the English, innit?" or whatever the current vernacular is.

I still haven't made up my mind. Do I go with the same old garbage from
London or do I try the new possible garbage from Edinburgh? Middle road
of not voting at all?

I'm interested in what you think of the whole thing. Contact me in the
usual places or leave a comment below.
