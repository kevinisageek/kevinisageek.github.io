After a long day out in Albuquerque, some form of sustenance is needed.
[Pig Monkey](http://pig-monkey.com) found a potential candidate so we
made our way there.

[Il Vicino](http://www.ilvicino.com) is an Italian restaurant
specialising in pizza but has other stuff available too. The strange
thing about the place is that you order and pay for your food before
being seated. However, that has the advantage of not needing to hang
about waiting for the servers to get your receipt and all that faffing
about.

We got ourselves seated and began to take in the atmosphere. The major
feature is the 2 large fired ovens used for cooking the pizzas and other
food. Evidently they cook really quickly because barely 5 minutes after
we sat down we had our food on the table. Quick service or what?

I can't speak for the others but my sandwich (a Panino Casino) was
bloody fantastic. Lots of ham and cheese with a nice side salad. Less
than \$10 after tax. It was so good that I left a \$5 tip. Seriously, if
you ever find yourself in Albuquerque then get to this place. You will
not regret it.

Il Vicino, 3403 Central NE, Albuquerque, NM, 87106. +1-505-266-7855.
