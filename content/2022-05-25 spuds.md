I've been meaning to have a go for a couple years. While we don't exactly have much proper ground to grow on, container gardening is potentially feasible. The neighbours upstairs had the same idea, putting out 2 planters of carrots. So I pulled the trigger and went for it.

Spare storage crate, drill a grid of holes in the bottom, mix 2 bags of compost with some sharp sand then drop a few tatties in. Water and wait.
