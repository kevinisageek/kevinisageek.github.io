I've been using [Patrick Rhone's Dash/Plus notation system](http://patrickrhone.com/dashplus/) for todo lists for a while now. While idly at work, I came up with a couple extra metadata notations for done items.

The issue I have had is when I do my lists, there is no space for results to be noted or extra explanation to be done. Putting the information at the end of the list gives no link back to where it came from and reviewing the initial todo item gives no idea of what was done.

Basically I solved this with a right angle bracket. The cool thing is it can be done on paper and digitally. +> for done items with more info elsewhere and >+ for the extra information later in the list (or another list altogether). Simple.
