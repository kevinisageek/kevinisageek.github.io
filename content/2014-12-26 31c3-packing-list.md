I'm headed to Hamburg, Germany for the [31st Chaos Communications
Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Main_Page), a week
filled with hacking, geekery and strange German food. Thought I would
make a post detailing the kit I am bringing with me since I have never
done one before.

I was going to bring either my Kifaru Express or the E&E for this trip
but I decided to get a new pack. The Express is way too big for the
short time I'm away for and I have had issues getting it into a plane
overhead locker. The E&E is just a bit too small to fit everything I
want to take with me.

Enter the [Goruck GR0](http://www.goruck.com/en/gr0). Plenty of room to
fit what I need yet not unwieldy.

-   Clothes in a Kifaru extra large pullout (2 pairs boxer shorts, 2
    pairs socks, 2 tshirts, 1 pair sleeping boxers, merino wool thermal
    top
-   1.2 litre (40oz) Klean Kanteen
-   Map of Hamburg
-   [Notebook](http://Kevinisageek.org/2014/05/10/i-comissioned-a-field-notes-leather-notebook-cover/ "I comissioned a Field Notes leather notebook cover"),
    Sharpie and passport
-   book
-   USB battery, mini and micro USB cables
-   Laptop and charger with EU plug (UK one in the photo)
-   Kindle (not shown)
-   Spork
-   Self aid kit
-   Towel, hygiene stuff and tissues

On me:

-   Tshirt, socks, boxers, trousers, hoodie, boots, hat
-   Pen, wallet, phone

Only 2 changes of clothes for a week? Won't you smell? No. The plan is
to wash the stuff I wore each day in the shower at the end of the day.
Gives me 2 days for everything to dry which is easily doable. Rotate as
I go. Trousers can go for a week without being washed though if they get
dirty I can wash them and they will be dry in the morning. Gotta love
synthetics.

Total pack weight: 10kg. [Pack light, go
