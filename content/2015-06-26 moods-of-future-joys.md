It is the [first half of his autobiographical account](http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/books/moods-of-future-joys-part-1-riding-into-africa/) of the 4 years he spent traversing the globe by bicycle on a slim budget of Â£7000. From London, through Europe, the Middle East and down the east of Africa.

> Mornings come peacefully on the road. I wake slowly with the daylight, turning in my sleeping bag, adjusting the bundle of clothes that act as my pillow and dozing off once or twice until my head is clear and ready to begin the day. I lie still and listen to the sounds outside my tent. Sometimes birdsong, sometimes whooshing vehicles, sometimes water, sometimes silence. I unzip the tent door and feel the fresh air on my face. I check the weather and particlarly the wind: strong winds can seriously spoil my day.
