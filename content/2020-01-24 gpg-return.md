I've started using [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) as my password manager, having exported the database from [KeepassX](https://www.keepassx.org/). Pass is basically a wrapper around GPG for the purposes of securing your passwords. The files are plain GPG encrypted files which means no weird database format to worry about. Additionally I am using a GPG smartcard as the store for the private keys so that physically needs to be plugged into my computer to do anything password related.

I'm not so bothered about using GPG for email purposes, still to date the number of emails from Facebook that were GPG encrypted is much larger than the sum of all other GPG mail I have received (and probably sent for that matter). So I'm going to use it opportunistically. [My public key is available](/media/misc/kevinatkevinisageekdotorg.public.gpg.asc) if folk want to help me beat Facebook.
