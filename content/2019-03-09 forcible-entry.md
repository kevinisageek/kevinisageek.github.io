[The guide](http://www.vententersearch.com/supplemental/fdny_fe.pdf) primarily focuses on how to get rapid entry to a premises on fire using various implements, as well as an overview of different doors and locking mechanisms. Obviously it is meant for legal rapid entry to save lives but also unintentionally [gives ideas when looking for a new home](https://twitter.com/RealSexyCyborg/status/1104327393538277376) or how to secure your current front door from people trying to gain unlawful entry.

It also reminds me that I want a [Halligan bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halligan_bar), more useful in a [post apoc situation than a crowbar](https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Crowbar).
