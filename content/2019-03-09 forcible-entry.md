[Naomi Wu posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RealSexyCyborg/status/1104327393538277376) a guide on forcible entry by the New York Fire Department. [The guide](http://www.vententersearch.com/supplemental/fdny_fe.pdf) primarily focuses on how to get rapid entry to a premises on fire using various implements, as well as an overview of different doors and locking mechanisms. Obviously it is meant for legal rapid entry to save lives but also unintentionally gives ideas on how to secure your own front door from people trying to gain unlawful entry.

It also reminds me that I want a [Halligan bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halligan_bar), more useful in a [post apoc situation than a crowbar](https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Crowbar).
