I've had a couple Joylent "meals" so far.

First one was weak. I don't think I put in enough powder. Barely any
chocolate flavour but still had a bit of the Weetabix dregs texture.

Second meal last night was much better. More pronounced flavour. I think
I added more powder and gave it a good mix with a hand blender.

Third meal will be consumed for lunch today. I actually measured it out.
One bag contains 515-520 grams of powder. I went with the high end and
split into three which gives just over 173g of powder in the mixer
bottle. Whisked that up and topped up to 600ml with water. Took a couple
of sips and it has improved again.
