My friend Scott recently got a new to him bike and as part of a shakedown, we decided it would be good to go to Loch Leven for a nice ride since the weather was good. He gifted me a pressurised garden sprayer from a supermarket when we met up, I explained my parter and I already have one for watering the plants.

No, this is for cleaning the bikes after. Genius.

Especially useful since I don't have access to mains water on the landing outside, nor the inclination to run a hose and power cord for a pressure washer.
