Title: Going CarFree (for a while at least)

The last month or so I have been commuting exclusively by bicycle, both acoustic and electric. I've been threatening to go carfree for a while now but never had the need. Until my car started giving me grief. Its been a money pit for a few years but this time, the steering was making a terrible grinding noise and while on holiday, I decided to get rid of it. Just in the nick of time, the steering failed completely in a car park.

To be honest, this was the kick I needed to actually go for the whole carfree thing. Having an ebike for night shift commuting has been the saving grace, makes getting up the hills at 5am much more tolerable. The only issue I've had has been the wind, rounding a corner and getting hit in the face with it is not the most pleasant experience. Nor are crosswinds while descending at 20mph. Supposedly getting into spring/summer so with any luck, the nasty weather is behind me, for the time being at least.
