[Dr. Gage](https://twitter.com/soozaphone) first came to my attention via [Scroobius Pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scroobius_Pip)'s [Distraction Pieces](http://www.scroobiuspip.co.uk/distraction-pieces-podcast/) podcast. She then started her own podcast, [Say Why to Drugs](https://suzigage.co.uk/podcast/) and has [just released a book of the same name](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Say-Why-Drugs-Everything-About/dp/1473686229) which basically collates the info given in the podcast into print form. It aims to give a good overview of the various substances consumed by humans - whether legal or otherwise - and does so without judgement or bias. Covering what the substance is, what it has been used for historically, what the intended effects are on the body and the potential side effects it has.

The book is very accessible with minimal clinical language and I think it should be required reading for high schoolers, or even earlier. Certainly much better than the puritanical ["drugs are bad"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7l8dx-h8M) approach I had at school.
