* Wake up around 5am (not quite #0445club but works for me)
* Pint of coffee
* [5km run](/2017/10/04/urban-run/)
* Shower
* Depending on how hungry I am, breakfast either before or at work

Been doing this the past week while pulling 12 hour shifts at work and I have to say it is working out really well for me. Combination of early runs and long days mean my sleep is much improved.
