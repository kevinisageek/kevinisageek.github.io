Met up with my friend [Scott (MM7CWE)](https://0x2a.tw/sota-adventures/) and the two of us schlepped up [Moncreiffe Hill](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/SS-276) in Perthshire. After throwing a tarp over a bench at the summit, I got my [Xiegu G90](https://www.sinotel.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=20&products_id=183&zenid=qe2c19iia9inc7d51tqbnocjb1) radio set up with the [SuperAntenna](http://newsuperantenna.com/) set up for 40 meters and after some faff with the slider coil and the ATU, we got started. Scott set up the spot with the [SOTA Spotter Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ro.netroute.sotaspotter), I called CQ SOTA a couple times and after about 30 seconds or so, we had contacts rolling in.

Didn't get the locations of all of them sadly, however the one that sticks in my mind was a gentleman from Bristol, which is a good bit away. Pretty impressive since I wasn't pushing all that much power.

After a spot of lunch, I took down the SuperAntenna and put up a dipole that Scott has kindly given to me. We had a bit of a tune around the bands. Scott showed how to use the ATU and SWR functions on the radio. Managed to pick up someone in Italy who was doing a contest which was pretty amazing.

Safe to say I have the bug now, we are going up another hill next weekend.
