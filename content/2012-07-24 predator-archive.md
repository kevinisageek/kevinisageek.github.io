Thought I would throw up a copy of some interesting files written by
Michael Carlton aka Predator. He was a rather influential dude from
Sydney, Australia who was involved in several underground media projects
and a whole bunch of other stuff. Alas, he is no more, having passed
nearly a decade ago. Information on the guy is surprisingly sparse, the
main project he was involved with, http://cat.org.au is offline so
information cannot be gleaned there.

However, all is not lost. I managed to get what is essentially a dump of
his home folder
([predarchive](/media/misc/predarchive.tar))
from my mate Harlequin, who I believe was connected to Pred in some way.
I have also just stumbled on the book which is mentioned in various
places,
[Pred.txt](/media/misc/pred.txt.pdf)(not
actually .txt but .pdf).

Go have a read, if you are anything like me, you will enjoy and want
more.
