An enterprising fellow has come up with a fantastic Chrome extension
which [swaps
all](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt)[occurrences of "the
cloud" with "my butt"](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).
Naturally I found that idea to be hilarious.

Folk have then gone on to make versions for
[Safari](https://github.com/logancollins/cloud-to-butt-safari),
[Firefox](https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-mozilla)
andÂ [Opera](https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-opera). Check it
out!
