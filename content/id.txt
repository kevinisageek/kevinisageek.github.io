GPG Public Key
==============

0EF0 B344 CAB4 684B 46E5  19F1 1077 E792 BAF4 5865 / 0xBAF45865

This is the only fingerprint/ID that I currently use. There are a bunch of others on various
keyservers that should be considered obsolete but due to not generating revocation certs,
I cannot invalidate them.

I will be moving to a smartcard based system in the near future so the key associated with this fingerprint
will be obsoleted then.

Key Signing Policy
==================

Level 3 "I have done very careful checking" certifications by me generally indicate that:
* I personally know the subject of the key by that name, and have for some time;
* I can readily and reliably recognize them; and
* I verified their key fingerprint "in person", which might include voice or video chat.

Level 2 "I have done casual checking" signatures by me generally indicate that:
* I physically met this person, not by voice or video chat;
* they presented me with very difficult to forge evidence of their identity; and
* I verified their key fingerprint at that time.

Notes:
* I do not have a specific metric for how long I have to know someone before being willing to 
certify their key based solely on our relationship. I use my judgement and discretion.
* I do not require that the UIDs I certify are someone's birth name, or the name on their government
 documents. I will certify a persistent pseudonym if that is the name someone goes by.
* "Very difficult to forge evidence of identity" often means state issued photo identification 
which I find convincing. It may also mean a personal attestation from someone who I know well and 
consider trustworthy.
