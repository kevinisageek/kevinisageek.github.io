My buddy Scott and myself have been trying to get his GPG system set up.
Signing to him works, he can sign mails to me, I can encrypt mail to
him. He can't send encrypted mails to me.

Long story short, my encryption subkey expired a few months ago. In my
defence, "expires" and "expired" look bloody similar in a monospaced
font on a terminal. I've extended the expiry date.  
[Grab my updated key
here](http://kevinisageek.org/gpg-public-key/ "GPG Public Key") or do
`gpg --recv-keys BAF45865` to update.
