I think I came across the TS100 soldering iron when watching an [Adam Savage video]() about his portable workshop. My usual soldering irons have been the cheap, unregulated sort that plug straight into the wall. I have a fancy regulated one but that also needs wall power.

The main advantage of the TS100 is that it can run off anywhere between 12 to 24 volts DC which makes it ideal for portable use. Its not an iron for day job use, more of a hobby one but it excels at that.

The fact it runs off DC means I can power it from my car, the battery I use for SOTA, or one of the many Lenovo power bricks I have.
