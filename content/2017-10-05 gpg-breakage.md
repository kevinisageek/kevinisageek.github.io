Needless to say I have completely regenerated my keychain and moved the subkeys to a smartcard for increased security. New public key (fingerprint: 116D B25C A5C4 73C5 3262 BEDC 8322 D167 9829 59BF) is in the [same place as always](/kevinatkevinisageekdotorg.gpg.asc).

Now to resume the regular flow of nobody using gpg to encrypt emails to me.
