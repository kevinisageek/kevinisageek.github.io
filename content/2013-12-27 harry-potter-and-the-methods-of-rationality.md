Started reading [Harry Potter and the Methods of
Rationality](http://hpmor.com/) again. I had a copy a while ago but it
seems to have vanished. For those not in the know, the book is written
by Eliezer YudkowskyÂ  and the
[LessWrong](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/LessWrong_Wiki) folk.

I'm not normally a fanfiction kind of person, most of the stuff I have
heard of tends to be...strange. Slash and suchlike. However, this is
actually quite good.
