Title: Drivetrain Refresh

I've not been the best custodian of my bike. I don't tend to do massive amounts of miles so maintenance tends to get neglected. Sadly, this is showing in the drivetrain. The [chain was slack](https://pig-monkey.com/2020/03/measuring-chain-wear/) and the cassette was filthy and looks worn so I figured I would replace them both. Considering that costs less than a tank of petrol for the car it's almost doable as a yearly service.

It was easy to [remove the lockring and cassette with the suitable tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-MYHOpzT5A) and I took the opportunity to remove the ["dork disc"](https://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_sp-ss.html#spokeprotector) that stops your chain falling off the high gear if your limit screw is set wrong.

I've added a reminder to my [todo list](https://taskwarrior.org) on a regular basis to encourage me to be a bit better with my preventative maintenance.
