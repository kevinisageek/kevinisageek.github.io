Just a quick note to say my [GPG public key](/misc/KevinatKevinisageekdotorg.gpg.asc) has been updated. Same fingerprint and key ID but I added an authentication subkey.

Also, I am in the process of migrating to a hardware token for increased security so my keychain will be completely regenerated at some point, once I have ironed out all the kinks and done some more research. Will keep you posted.
