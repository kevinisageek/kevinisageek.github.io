Title: I've had to crack open a Waterbrick for actual use.

The property next door has suffered some sort of failure with their water. There was a constant stream being ejected from under the gutter and required the fire brigade to force entry to see what the issue is. However they couldn't stop it so the water was shut off at the [stopcock](https://www.emergencyplumber.uk.com/plumbing/main-stopcock/) outside that property.

For reasons unknown to me, this block of flats is also served via this stopcock, resulting in zero cold water pressure.

Naturally, [I have prepared for this](2020/03/05/sterile).

I can continue to enjoy my morning brews until this gets fixed.
